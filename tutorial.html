<h2>Basic theme</h2>
<p>You are Matt Damon and spend your time on a deserted Planet. After Matt Damon suddenly capsizes with his
ship and runs ashore at your beach, your peaceful times are disturbed. To give Matt Damon a chance to
leave the Planet again, you start to teach him to improve his survival abilities against the hazards of
the Planet.</p>
</p>If Matt Damon beats two Final Chapters at the end of the game, he successfully leaves the planet and you will make it back to earth...</p>

<h2>Idea of the Game</h2>
<p>»Stranded« is a solo adventure. While playing you are trying to guide Matt Damon through the game.
He must win against two Final Chapters without dying to finally leave the planet again. At the start of the
game Matt Damon is not very cunning. In this game the pile of fighting cards represents his abilities.
By comparison Matt Damon‘s health is in good shape and he starts with many life points.</p>

<p>You have two possibilities to help Matt Damon. You can either cleverly beat the hazards of the planet
and receive additional cards to improve Matt Damon‘s fighting abilities, or you deliberately lose against
certain hazards and pay with Matt Damon‘s life points to remove unwanted fighting cards from play.
During the game you will improve the quality and quantity of your fighting cards thanks to both
possibilities and help Matt Damon with his newly gained abilities and knowledge to win against even
more difficult hazards. However, life on the planet is energy-sapping for Matt Damon so he is forced to
always add aging cards to his fighting cards pile. These cards are all cumbersome, so you‘d better
remember to keep them in mind when planning your next steps.</p>


<p>It is up to you. Use Matt Damon‘s life points cleverly and choose the correct hazards to keep Matt Damon
healthy and strong for the final fights against both Final Chapters.</p>

<p>The game offers several difficulty levels. Firstly, we explain the easiest game to you - Level 1. As soon
as you win this level, you can try three additional levels and try to play against the next challenge. Do
you finally beat the game in Level 4?</p>

<h2>Game Components</h2>

<h2>Preparations</h2>

<h3>Your first game starts in Level 1:</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Sort the step cards and place the pile in front of you. The green card should be visible on top of the
	pile, below are the yellow and red cards. The game starts with the green step.</li>

	<li>Remove the aging card »Very Stupid« from the game. Sort the remaining 10 aging cards in two
	piles (7x normal and 3x difficult ), shuffle both piles and place them as a single facedown
	stack on the aging storage board. Place the normal aging cards on top of the stack.
	You will need these aging cards later during the game.</li>

	<li>Shuffle the 18 starting cards and place the face-down stack on the Matt Damon storage board in
	front of yourself. These are your first fighting cards.</li>

	<li>Shuffle the 30 hazard cards and place the face-down stack on the hazard storage board.</li>

	<li>Shuffle the Final Chapter cards, draw two random Final Chapters and place them face-up as your final opponents. Place the remaining Final Chapter cards back in the game box.</li>

	<li>Take 20 life points for Matt Damon and place them next to your Matt Damon stack. Place 2 more life points as the reserve next to the play area.</li>

	<li>Set aside some space next to the Matt Damon and hazard stacks for the appropriate discard piles.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Playing the game</h2>

<p>During the game you will help Matt Damon to fight one hazard in each game turn. You start the game in
the »green Step«, when the hazards are still mostly harmless. Sadly, the same is true for Matt Damon‘s
abilities (meaning your fighting cards). You might lose several of the first fights against the hazards.</p>

<p>In each game turn you play the following actions in the order as written:</p>

<h3>1. Drawing two hazard cards.</h3>

<p>Draw the two topmost cards of the hazard pile. Choose one of the two cards as the actual hazard and
place it face up in front of the Matt Damon stack. Discard the other card on the hazard discard pile.</p>

<h3>2. Fight against the hazard.</h3>

<p>The white box on the left side of the hazard card shows the number of fighting cards you can
draw for free to fight against the hazard. During the »green Step« you must get fighting points
equal or in excess of the green hazard value . You draw one fighting card after another from the
Matt Damon stack and place them face up on the left side of the hazard card. You can draw and place
new cards on the left side until the number equals the value of the white box.</p>

<p>After drawing the free cards you can »sacrifice« additional life points and place them back into the
reserve to draw 1 fighting card for each sacrificed life point. You place the additional card(s) on the
right side of the hazard card.</p>

<p>After drawing each fighting card you can always decide to use the special ability of any drawn faceup
fighting card (regardless of left or right cards) in any order you like. You can use each special ability
only once during the fight against the hazard and turn the chosen card 90°. Only after using the ability
completely, you can activate the next ability of another card (see special abilities on page 10).</p>

<p>Note: You must definitely use the special abilites of the aging cards!</p>

<p>After you draw at least one fighting card against the hazard, you can decide to stop drawing
additional cards, even if you do not draw all the free cards as written in the white box. You choose
to do this for one of the two reasons: Either you have already won against the hazard (see »3. You
win against the hazard?«) or you deliberately lose against the hazard (see »4. You lose against the
hazard?«).</p>

<p><i>During the game it is very important for you to decide if you want to spend more life points to win a
fight or to deliberately lose the fight and pay to remove worse cards. Both decisions are integral parts
of your strategy. It is not unusual to lose several of the first fights in the »green step«. This is part of
this game!</i></p>

<p>The fight does not end automatically. You can use all remaining special abilities. Only if you want to
end the fight, you compare your fighting points with the hazard value and finally finish the fight.</p>

<h3>3. You win against the hazard?</h3>

<p>If the sum of all fighting points of your face up fighting cards is at least equal or higher to the
hazard value (matching the actual step), you beat the hazard and win the fight. Place the hazard
card together with your played cards onto your discard pile. The gained hazard card converts to a new
fighting card in your Matt Damon pile. You use the knowledge side of the card.</p>

<h3>4. You lose against the hazard?</h3>

<p>If you deliberately lose the fight and the sum of all fighting points of your face up fighting cards is less
than the hazard value, you must pay life points to the reserve matching the number of points you are
missing to win against the hazard (the difference of the hazard value and your total fighting points).</p>

<p>For the life points you pay in this manner you can destroy played fighting cards and remove them
from the game. You need one life point for one of the starting or knowledge cards . To destroy
an aging card, you need two life points . You must place the undefeated hazard card on the
hazard discard pile and the fighting cards back on the Matt Damon discard pile. You are not allowed to
»sacrifice« additional life points to destroy additional unwanted cards. You can only destroy face-up
fighting cards, which are played during the actual fight. All cards in the Matt Damon stack, the Matt Damon
discard pile or the actual hazard card are safe.</p>

Example (you win against the hazard):
After Robinson sacrifies a life token he succesfully explores the Island thanks to the card »genius«.
From now on he can use the weapon in the following fights.

<h3>5. Start again at action 1.</h3>

<p>If there are at least 2 hazard cards left in the hazard stack, start again with action 1. Draw 2 more
hazard cards, choose one and fight against it in the actual Step.</p>

<p>If the hazard stack is empty, the game continues with the next (more difficult) step. Place the topmost
Step card back in the box and continue the game with the following Step (after the »green Step« you
play the »yellow Step«, after the »yellow Step« you play the »red Step«. After finishing the »red Step«
you finally fight against the Final Chapters). At the beginning of a new Step shuffle the hazard discard pile
and continue again with action 1.</p>

<p>At the end of a Step, if there is only exactly one card left in the hazard pile, you draw this card and
can decide if you want to fight against this card in the actual Step. Instead of fighting you can decide
to discard this card without fighting it and continue with the next Step (similar to an empty hazard
pile).</p>

<h3>No more fighting cards in the Matt Damon stack</h3>

<p>During the whole game, the following rules are active:</p>

<p>If you need or want to draw one or more fighting cards from the Matt Damon stack, but there are not
enough cards left to draw, you draw the remaining cards until the stack is depleted. Afterwards you
must take the topmost face-down aging card from the aging stack and shuffle it into the fighting
cards (Do not look at the aging card!). Place all cards back on the storage board as the new
Matt Damon stack and draw the missing cards.</p>

<p>You only shuffle the Matt Damon discard pile, if you need to draw another fighting card (not already at
the time, when you draw the last remaining card of the Matt Damon stack).</p>

<h3>The final showdown against the Final Chapters</h3>

<p>After you finish the hazard stack a third time, you fight against the two Final Chapters. The remaining hazard
cards in the hazard discard pile are not used anymore.</p>

<p>You choose one of the Final Chapters, place him in front of Matt Damon and start the fight previously discussed
on p. 4. The Final Chapters act exactly like hazard cards. After you beat the first Final Chapter, you place all drawn
fighting cards on the Matt Damon discard pile and you must immediately fight against the other Final Chapter.</p>

<p>You must win against the Final Chapters! You cannot decide to lose and pay with life points. If your played
Matt Damon cards do not have enough fighting points to beat the Final Chapter, you must sacrifice life tokens to
draw more Matt Damon cards.</p>

<h2>Game End</h2>

<p>After you beat the second Final Chapter, you win the game.</p>

<p>If you need to pay a life token during the game and do not have any left you immediately lose the
game. Having zero life points is OK, but if you need one more life token you lose the game!</p>

<h2>Special abilities of the fighting cards</h2>

<h2>Starting and knowledge cards</h2>

<p>During a fight you can use the special abilities of all drawn fighting cards in any order you like. When
you activate a special ability, you must finish it before you can use the special ability of another card.<p>

<p><span>+1 life:</span> You can take 1 life point from the reserve and add it to Matt Damon‘s storage (Max. 22 life points).</p>

<p><span>+2 life:</span> You can take up to 2 life tokens from the reserve and add them to Matt Damon‘s storage (Max.
22 life points).</p>

<p><span>+1 card:</span> You can draw 1 additional fighting card for free (place it on the right side of the hazard card).</p>

<p><span>+2 cards:</span> You can draw up to 2 additional fighting cards for free (place them on the right side of the
hazard card).</p>

<p><span>1x destroy:</span> Not all fighting cards in the Matt Damon stack are helpful for you.With this special ability
you turn 1 of the other drawn fighting cards face-down. The abilities of this card are canceled for the
actual fight, but the card still counts as a fighting card and has a fighting value of 0. This card cannot
be removed anymore by another special ability! After the end of the fight you destroy this face-down
card and remove it from the game.</p>

<p><span>1x double:</span> You can double the fighting value of 1 of the other drawn fighting cards. You can only
double a single fighting value once per fight. If you have multiple copies of this ability, you must use
them on different fighting cards, this ability is not cumulative! This ability is only activated at the end
of the fight, when you compare your fighting value with the hazard value.</p>

<p><span>1x copy:</span> You can copy the special ability of 1 of the other drawn fighting cards, to use it again.
You can copy the same ability with several »copy« abilities.</p>

<p><span>step -1:</span> If you fight against a hazard in the »yellow Step« or the »red Step«, you can reduce the
hazard value by one Step (e.g. if you fight against a »yellow Step« hazard, you now check the green
hazard value instead of the yellow one). This action is only activated at the end of the fight, when you
compare your fighting value with the hazard value. This special ability is useless against »green Step«
hazards and Final Chapters.</p>

<p><span>sort 3 cards:</span> You can draw up to 3 cards one after the other from the Matt Damon stack and look at
them. Afterwards you can discard up to 1 of these cards on the Matt Damon discard pile and place the
remaining cards face-down back on the Matt Damon stack in the order you choose.</p>

<p><span>1x exchange:</span> You place 1 of the other drawn face-up fighting cards on the Matt Damon discard pile (you
can choose one card you already used for the special ability) and draw a new card as replacement.
Place it on the same spot of the discarded card. If the new card has a special ability, you can use it now
or later during the fight.</p>

<p><span>2x exchange:</span> You can exchange up to 2 of the other drawn cards. You must finish the first exchange
before starting the second exchange. You can directly exchange the newly drawn card during the
second time (of course if you do this, you cannot use the special ability of this exchanged card).</p>

<p><span>1x below the stack:</span> You place 1 of the other drawn drawn fighting cards back below the Matt Damon
stack. If you choose one of the free cards from the left side of the hazard card, you can draw an
exchange card. The Matt Damon stack must consist of at least 1 single card to use this special ability. If the
Matt Damon stack is empty, shuffle the Matt Damon discard pile (see »No more cards in the Matt Damon stack«
on page 7).</p>

<h2>Aging cards</h2>

<p>You must use the special abilities of the aging cards during the fight against a hazard card! If you
destroy or remove one of these cards with help of another special ability, the special ability is canceled
(this is the same while fighting against Final Chapters).</p>

<p><span>-1 life:</span> At the end of the fight you must pay 1 (additional) life point to the reserve, even if you win
the fight. You cannot use this life point to destroy one of the drawn fighting cards!</p>

<p><span>-2 life:</span> At the end of the fight you must pay 2 (additional) life points to the reserve, even if you win
the fight. You cannot use these life points to destroy one (or more) of the drawn fighting cards!
highest card = 0: When checking for the result of the fight, the highest unchanged positive fighting
value of one of your drawn fighting cards counts as 0 fighting points. If you have several cards with the
equally highest fighting value, only one card is affected.</p>

<p><span>stop:</span> This card stops your drawing of free cards. If you must place this card on the left side of the
hazard card, you immediately must stop drawing free cards, even if you did not get all the allowed
free cards. If you place this card as one of the additional cards on the right side of the hazard card, this
card only has a fighting value of 0. If you destroy or remove this card during the fight, you might be
able to continue to draw free cards, as long as you still get free cards.</p>

<h2>Final Chapter cards</h2>

<p>Five normal Final Chapter cards only show the hazard value and the number of free cards , you can draw during the fight
against these Final Chapters. Five additional Final Chapters also have special abilities, where these instructions may vary.</p>

<p><span>- Each additional fighting card costs 2 life points:</span> After drawing all the free fighting cards, you
must pay 2 life points for each additional fighting card against this Final Chapter (instead of the usual 1 life
point for each card). If you only have 1 life point left and still must draw cards, you place this life
point back into the reserve and lose the game.</p>

<p><span>- Only half of the fighting cards count (aging cards must be part of this):</span> You can only use the
fighting points of half of the drawn fighting cards. You must use all drawn aging cards, they block
one of the rare places. If you have an odd number of cards, you can round up in your favor.</p>

<p><span>- Each drawn fighting card counts +1 fighting point:</span> At the end of the fight you add 1 fighting
point for all drawn fighting cards (starting cards, aging cards, knowledge cards and via special
actions turned cards) to your total.</p>

<p><span>- Fight against all remaining hazard cards:</span> Add up all red hazard points of the remaining
undefeated hazard cards (»red Step«) in the hazard discard pile for the hazard value of this Final Chapter.
Add up all values in the white boxes for the number of free fighting cards you can draw for this fight.
(At the game end all these hazard cards still count -3 points when you determine your score!)</p>

<p><span>- +2 hazard points for each aging card added to your Matt Damon stack:</span> Count the number of aging
cards you needed to add to your Matt Damon stack during the game, before you start fighting against
this Final Chapter. Each of these cards adds +2 hazard points for the hazard value of this Final Chapter. You can
count the remaining aging cards on the aging storage board (you start with 10 cards on this board,
11 cards in level 3 and 4 - see below).</p>

<h2>Scoring</h2>

<p>After each game you can calculate your victory points. Will you get better with more experience?</p>

<ol>
	<li>Take all your fighting cards (together with your Matt Damon discard pile) and add all the fighting
	values. All aging cards have a value of -5 regardless of their real fighting points for this purpose.</li>

	<li>Add 15 points for each defeated Final Chapter card (undefeated Final Chapters are ignored).</li>

	<li>Add 5 points for each remaining life point you still have in Matt Damon‘s storage (you only have them
	if you win the game).</li>

	<li>Subtract 3 points for each unbeaten hazard card still in the hazard discard pile.</li>
</ol>

<p>When calculating the scores you can compare your different games and successes in each Level.</p>

<p>The higher the level, the more difficult it will be for you to get a high score.</p>
