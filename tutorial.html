<h2>Story...</h2>
<p>After Mark Watnee (You) is left behind because his fellow astronauts couldn't "deal" with the Martian climate, you're left to your own resources. To give Mark Watnee a chance to
leave the Planet again, your goal is teach him to develop his survival abilities against the constant endangerments of
the Planet.</p>
</p>If Mark Watnee beats two Final Chapters at the end of the game, he successfully leaves the planet and you will make it back to earth...</p>

<h2>Idea of the Game</h2>
<p>»Stranded« is a game designed for one player. As you navigate the ongoing endangerments your goal is to win against two Final Chapters without dying (losing all life points) to finally leave the planet again. At the start of the
game Mark Watnee is back to basics with limited resources at hand. In this game the deck of fighting cards represents his abilities.
Luckily, Mark Watnee‘s health is in good shape and he starts with many life points.</p>

<p>You have two ways to help Mark Watnee, either:</p>
<ol>
<li>Beat the endangerments of the planet and receive additional cards to improve Mark Watnee‘s fighting abilities, or...</li>
<li>you deliberately lose against certain endangerments and pay with Mark Watnee‘s life points to remove unwanted fighting cards from play.</li>
</ol>
<p>During the game you will improve the quality and quantity of your fighting cards thanks to both
possibilities and help Mark Watnee with his newly gained abilities and knowledge to win against even
more difficult endangerments. However, life on the Martian atmospher is tough on the body for Mark Watnee so he is forced to
always add aging cards to his fighting cards pile. Remember, you can get rid of these cards using your life points.</p>

<h2>Preparations</h2>

<h3>Your First Game</h3>

<img src="cardimg/stranded-game-board.jpg" class="tutorial-image" />

<h2>Playing the game</h2>

<p>During the game you will help Mark Watnee to fight one endangerment in each game turn. You start the game in
the »Green Sol/Phase«, when the endangerments are still mostly harmless. Sadly, the same is true for Mark Watnee‘s
abilities (meaning your fighting cards). You might lose several of the first fights against the endangerments.</p>

<p>In each game turn you play the following actions in the order as written:</p>

<h3>1. Drawing two endangerment cards.</h3>

<p>When clicking "Deal" you will draw the two cards of the endangerment pile. Click on one of the two cards as the actual endangerment and
press "Select" to place in the »Danger Zone«. The other card will be placed in the endangerment discard pile.</p>

<h3>2. Fight against the endangerment.</h3>

<p>The white box on the left side of the endangerment card shows the number of fighting cards you can
draw for free to fight against the endangerment. During the »Green Sol/Phase« you must get fighting points
equal or in excess of the green endangerment value . You draw one fighting card after another from the
Mark Watnee stack by pressing "Add Card". You can draw new cards until the number equals the value of the white box.</p>

<p>After drawing the free cards you can »sacrifice« additional life points and place them back into the
reserve to draw 1 fighting card for each sacrificed life point.</p>

<p>After drawing each fighting card you can always decide to use the special ability of any drawn faceup
fighting card in any order you like. You can use each special ability
only once during the fight against the endangerment. Only after using the ability
completely, you can activate the next ability of another card (see special abilities).</p>

<p>Note: The special abilites of the aging cards will automatically be used!</p>

<p>After you draw at least one fighting card against the endangerment, you can decide to stop drawing
additional cards, even if you do not draw all the free cards as written in the white box. You choose
to do this for one of the two reasons: Either you have already won against the endangerment (see »3. You
win against the endangerment?«) or you deliberately lose against the endangerment (see »4. You lose against the
endangerment?«).</p>

<p><i>During the game it is very important for you to decide if you want to spend more life points to win a
fight or to deliberately lose the fight and pay to remove worse cards. Both decisions are integral parts
of your strategy. It is not unusual to lose several of the first fights in the »Green Sol/Phase«. This is part of
this game!</i></p>

<p>The fight does not end automatically. You can use all remaining special abilities. Only if you want to
end the fight, you compare your fighting points with the endangerment value and finally finish the fight.</p>

<h3>3. You win against the endangerment?</h3>

<p>If the sum of all fighting points of your face up fighting cards is at least equal or higher to the
endangerment value (matching the actual step), you beat the endangerment and win the fight. The endangerment card will be placed in your discard pile along with your other fighting cards. The gained endangerment card converts to a new
fighting card in your Mark Watnee pile. You use the knowledge side of the card.</p>

<h3>4. You lose against the endangerment?</h3>

<p>If you deliberately lose the fight and the sum of all fighting points of your face up fighting cards is less
than the endangerment value, you must pay life points to the reserve matching the number of points you are
missing to win against the endangerment (the difference of the endangerment value and your total fighting points).</p>

<p>For the life points you pay in this manner you can destroy played fighting cards and remove them
from the game. You need one life point for one of the starting or knowledge cards . To destroy
an aging card, you need two life points. Your undefeated endangerment card will be placed on the
endangerment discard pile and the fighting cards back on the Mark Watnee discard pile. You are not allowed to
»sacrifice« additional life points to destroy additional unwanted cards. You can only destroy face-up
fighting cards, which are played during the actual fight. All cards in the Mark Watnee stack, the Mark Watnee
discard pile or the actual endangerment card are safe.</p>

<h3>5. Start again at action 1.</h3>

<p>If there are at least 2 endangerment cards left in the endangerment stack, start again with action 1. Draw 2 more
endangerment cards, choose one and fight against it in the actual Step.</p>

<p>If the endangerment stack is empty, the game continues with the next (more difficult) step. Place the topmost
Step card back in the box and continue the game with the following Step (after the »Green Sol/Phase« you
play the »Yellow Sol/Phase«, after the »Yellow Sol/Phase« you play the »Red Sol/Phase«. After finishing the »Red Sol/Phase«
you finally fight against the Final Chapters). At the beginning of a new Step shuffle the endangerment discard pile
and continue again with action 1.</p>

<p>At the end of a Step, if there is only exactly one card left in the endangerment pile, you will be forced to draw this card into the play pile.</p>

<h3>No more fighting cards in the Mark Watnee stack</h3>

<p>During the whole game, the following rules are active:</p>

<p>If you need or want to draw one or more fighting cards from the Mark Watnee stack, but there are not
enough cards left to draw, you draw the remaining cards until the stack is depleted. Afterwards you
must add an aging card from the aging stack which will shuffle it into the fighting
cards. Place all cards back on the storage board as the new Mark Watnee stack and draw the missing cards.</p>

<h3>The final showdown against the Final Chapters</h3>

<p>After you finish the endangerment stack a third time, you fight against the two Final Chapters. The remaining endangerment
cards in the endangerment discard pile are not used anymore.</p>

<p>You choose one of the Final Chapters, and deal it likely you would the endangerment card. The Final Chapters act exactly like endangerment cards. After you beat the first Final Chapter, you must immediately fight against the other Final Chapter.</p>

<p>You must win against the Final Chapters! You cannot decide to lose and pay with life points. If your played
Mark Watnee cards do not have enough fighting points to beat the Final Chapter, you must sacrifice life tokens to
draw more Mark Watnee cards.</p>

<h2>Game End</h2>

<p>After you beat the second Final Chapter, you win the game.</p>

<p>If you need to pay a life token during the game and do not have any left you immediately lose the
game. Having zero life points is OK, but if you need one more life token you lose the game!</p>

<h2>Special abilities of the fighting cards</h2>

<h2>Starting and knowledge cards</h2>

<p>During a fight you can use the special abilities of all drawn fighting cards in any order you like. When
you activate a special ability, you must finish it before you can use the special ability of another card.<p>

<p><span>+1 life:</span> You can take 1 life point from the reserve and add it to Mark Watnee‘s Life Pointa (Max. 22 life points).</p>

<p><span>+2 life:</span> You can take up to 2 life tokens from the reserve and add them to Mark Watnee‘s Life Points (Max.
22 life points).</p>

<p><span>+1 card:</span> You can draw 1 additional fighting card for free.</p>

<p><span>+2 cards:</span> You can draw up to 2 additional fighting cards for free.</p>

<p><span>1x destroy:</span> Not all fighting cards in the Mark Watnee stack are helpful for you.With this special ability
you will trash one card in your hand</p>

<p><span>1x double:</span> You can double the fighting value of 1 of the other drawn fighting cards. You can only
double a single fighting value once per fight. If you have multiple copies of this ability, you must use
them on different fighting cards, this ability is not cumulative!</p>

<p><span>1x copy:</span> You can copy the special ability of 1 of the other drawn fighting cards, to use it again.
You can copy the same ability with several »copy« abilities.</p>

<p><span>step -1:</span> If you fight against a endangerment in the »Yellow Sol/Phase« or the »Red Sol/Phase«, you can reduce the
endangerment value by one Step (e.g. if you fight against a »Yellow Sol/Phase« endangerment, you now check the green
endangerment value instead of the yellow one). This special ability is useless against »Green Sol/Phase«
endangerments and Final Chapters.</p>

<p><span>sort 3 cards:</span> You can draw up to 3 cards one after the other from the Mark Watnee stack and look at
them. Afterwards you can discard up to 1 of these cards on the Mark Watnee discard pile and place the
remaining cards face-down back on the Mark Watnee stack in the order you choose.</p>

<p><span>1x exchange:</span> You place 1 of the other drawn face-up fighting cards on the Mark Watnee discard pile (you
can choose one card you already used for the special ability) and draw a new card as replacement. If the new card has a special ability, you can use it now
or later during the fight.</p>

<p><span>2x exchange:</span> You can exchange up to 2 of the other drawn cards. You must finish the first exchange
before starting the second exchange. You can directly exchange the newly drawn card during the
second time (of course if you do this, you cannot use the special ability of this exchanged card).</p>

<p><span>1x below the stack:</span> You place 1 of the other drawn drawn fighting cards back below the Mark Watnee
stack. If you choose one of the free cards from the left side of the endangerment card, you can draw an
exchange card. The Mark Watnee stack must consist of at least 1 single card to use this special ability. If the
Mark Watnee stack is empty, shuffle the Mark Watnee discard pile (see »No more cards in the Mark Watnee stack«).</p>

<h2>Aging cards</h2>

<p>You will automatically use the special abilities of the aging cards during the fight against an endangerment card! If you
destroy or remove one of these cards with help of another special ability, the special ability is canceled
(this is the same while fighting against Final Chapters).</p>

<p><span>-1 life:</span> At the end of the fight you must pay 1 (additional) life point to the life points bank, even if you win
the fight. You cannot use this life point to destroy one of the drawn fighting cards!</p>

<p><span>-2 life:</span> At the end of the fight you must pay 2 (additional) life points to the life points bank, even if you win
the fight. You cannot use these life points to destroy one (or more) of the drawn fighting cards!
highest card = 0: When checking for the result of the fight, the highest unchanged positive fighting
value of one of your drawn fighting cards counts as 0 fighting points. If you have several cards with the
equally highest fighting value, only one card is affected.</p>

<p><span>stop:</span> This card stops your drawing of free cards. If you destroy or remove this card during the fight, you might be
able to continue to draw free cards, as long as you still get free cards.</p>
